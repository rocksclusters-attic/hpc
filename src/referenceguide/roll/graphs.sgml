<title> Graphs Directory </title>

<para>
Inside the <computeroutput>graphs</computeroutput> directory, you should
create another directory named <computeroutput>default</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>
Looking back at the Intel Roll, there is one file in its
<computeroutput>graphs/default</computeroutput> directory called:
<computeroutput>roll/intel/graphs/default/intel.xml</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>
This file describes how all the files in the
<computeroutput>nodes</computeroutput> directory are linked together
in the kickstart graph.
For example, in 
<computeroutput>roll/intel/graphs/default/intel.xml</computeroutput>
we see that the XML configuration node file
<computeroutput>roll/intel/nodes/intel.xml</computeroutput>
is linked into the <computeroutput>frontend</computeroutput> node.
</para>

<para>
To see how this works, below is an excerpt from the kickstart graph 
when the Intel Roll is installed:
</para>

<para>
<mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	<imagedata fileref="images/rollguide/graph.png" scale="75">
	</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>

<para>
The edge which travels from the node labeled
<emphasis>frontend</emphasis> to the node labeled
<emphasis>intel</emphasis> is result of the specification found in
<computeroutput>roll/intel/graphs/default/intel.xml</computeroutput>
which looks like:
</para>

<screen>
&lt;edge from="frontend"&gt;
        &lt;to&gt;intel&lt;/to&gt;
&lt;/edge&gt;
</screen>

<para>
See the <xref linkend="graph-xml"> section for graph file syntax.

<title> Using a Graph File to Add Packages </title>

<para>
This section describes how to use the nodes and graphs files to direct
the installer to add packages to the frontend or the compute nodes.
</para>

<para>
Say you have 4 packages and they're named:
package-one, package-two, package-three and package-four.
You want to add package-one and package-two to the frontend and you want to
add package-three and package-four to the compute nodes.
Also, say the name of your roll is <emphasis>diamond</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
First, in your development source tree, you'll create the file
<computeroutput>roll/diamond/nodes/diamond-frontend.xml</computeroutput>
which looks like:
</para>

<screen>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;

&lt;kickstart&gt;

&lt;description&gt;
The Diamond Roll.
&lt;/description&gt;

&lt;changelog&gt;
&lt;/changelog&gt;

&lt;package&gt;package-one&lt;/package&gt;
&lt;package&gt;package-two&lt;/package&gt;

&lt;post&gt;
&lt;!-- post configuration scripts go here --&gt;
&lt;/post&gt;

&lt;/kickstart&gt; 
</screen>

<para>
Then you'll create the file
<computeroutput>roll/diamond/nodes/diamond-compute.xml</computeroutput>
which looks like:
</para>

<screen>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;

&lt;kickstart&gt;

&lt;description&gt;
The Diamond Roll.
&lt;/description&gt;

&lt;changelog&gt;
&lt;/changelog&gt;

&lt;package&gt;package-three&lt;/package&gt;
&lt;package&gt;package-four&lt;/package&gt;

&lt;post&gt;
&lt;!-- post configuration scripts go here --&gt;
&lt;/post&gt;

&lt;/kickstart&gt; 
</screen>

<para>
Now you'll create the graph file 
<computeroutput>roll/diamond/graphs/default/diamond.xml</computeroutput>.
This file is what links the nodes files
<computeroutput>diamond-frontend.xml</computeroutput>
and
<computeroutput>diamond-compute.xml</computeroutput>
into the full kickstart graph that is created on the frontend during
the frontend's installation.
</para>

<para>
The graph file for the diamond roll:
</para>

<screen>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;

&lt;graph&gt;

&lt;description&gt;
The Diamond Roll.
&lt;/description&gt;

&lt;changelog&gt;
&lt;/changelog&gt;

&lt;edge from="frontend"&gt;
	&lt;to&gt;diamond-frontend&lt;/to&gt;
&lt;/edge&gt;

&lt;edge from="compute"&gt;
	&lt;to&gt;diamond-compute&lt;/to&gt;
&lt;/edge&gt;

&lt;/graph&gt;
</screen>

<section id="graphs-works"
	xreflabel="How it Works">

<title> How it Works</title>

<para>
During the installation of the frontend, the frontend's kickstart graph
will be generated after all the rolls have been inserted by the user.
That is, when the user answers 'No' to the the install screen that
asks 'Do you have a Roll CD/DVD?', the installer will traverse the graph files
and node files from all the rolls that were added to the frontend and
build a RedHat-compliant kickstart file based on which nodes it traverses.
The installation of the frontend is dictated by this generated kickstart
file.
</para>

<para>
In the above example, 
for a frontend installation, the node file
<emphasis>diamond-frontend</emphasis> will be traversed (and therefore
included in the frontend's kickstart file), but the node file
<emphasis>diamond-compute</emphasis> will not.
</para>

<para>
But, after the frontend is installed and when compute nodes are being
installed, the node file
<emphasis>diamond-compute</emphasis> will be traversed (and therefore
included in the computes' kickstart file), but the node file
<emphasis>diamond-frontend</emphasis> will not.
</para>
