<para>
If you have any pre-built RPMS (for example, an RPM that you downloaded),
you should place them in the <computeroutput>RPMS</computeroutput>
directory.
</para>

<para>
All RPMS that you build from scratch (which will be built out of the
files found under the 
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput>
directory) will be automatically put in this directory.
