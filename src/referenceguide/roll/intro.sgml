<para>
This section guides developers on how to build a Roll.
</para>

<para>
To get started, login to a Rocks frontend
and perform a
<ulink
url="http://www.rocksclusters.org/rocks-documentation/&version;/anonymous-cvs.html">
CVS checkout of the Rocks code</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
After the CVS checkout is completed, go to the top-level roll directory:
</para>

<screen>
# cd rocks/src/roll
</screen>

<para>
You should see something similar to:
</para>

<screen>
bin           cacl    etc            hpc       metaroll.mk  patch
birn          condor  gfarm          intel     nbcr         pbs
birn-oracle1  CVS     grid           java      ninf         sge
birn-oracle2  demo    grid-rocks-ca  Makefile  optiputer    top500
</screen>

<para>
Now create a new directory for your roll -- the direcory name will be the
name of your roll.
For example, let's say you want your roll to be called
<emphasis>skel</emphasis>:
</para>

<screen>
# mkdir skel
</screen>

<para>
To describe what directories and files you need to build your roll, we'll
use the <computeroutput>intel</computeroutput> roll as a guide.
In the directory 
<computeroutput>intel</computeroutput>, you'll see:
</para>

<screen>
CVS  graphs  Makefile  nodes  RPMS  src  SRPMS  version.mk
</screen>

<para>
Copy the files <computeroutput>Makefile</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>version.mk</computeroutput> into your roll:
</para>

<screen>
# cp Makefile version.mk ../skel/
</screen>

<para>
The first file, <computeroutput>Makefile</computeroutput>, should remain
unchanged.
It includes other files in order to drive the roll building process.
</para>

<para>
The second file, <computeroutput>version.mk</computeroutput>, should only
be modified if you wish to change the version number or release number of
your roll.
</para>

<para>
Now make the directories:
<computeroutput>graphs, nodes, RPMS, SRPMS and src</computeroutput>.
Your roll should look like:
</para>

<screen>
&lt; roll name &gt; ----+
	          |
	          +- graphs -+
	          |
	          +- nodes -+
	          |
	          +- RPMS -+
	          |
	          +- SRPMS -+
	          |
	          +- src -+
	          |
	          +- version.mk
	          |
	          +- Makefile
</screen>

<para>
Inside the <computeroutput>nodes</computeroutput> directory, you will put your
Rocks-based XML configuration files.
These files are used to install packages and to configure their respective
services.
</para>

<para>
In the Intel Roll, the file
<computeroutput>roll/intel/nodes/intel.xml</computeroutput>
has the package names for the compilers to be installed on specific hardware
architectures.
For example, the <computeroutput>intel-icc8</computeroutput> is installed
with the line:
</para>

<screen>
&lt;package&gt;intel-icc8&lt;/package&gt;
</screen>
