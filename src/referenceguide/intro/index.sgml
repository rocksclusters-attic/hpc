This book gives a Reference Guide for the Rocks Cluster Distribution. We intend
for this publication to illuminate the specifics of our system.  Instead of
giving philosophies or behavior, this guide is a hard-core software and API
reference. Essentially we provide a blueprint and a lesson on the languages
used in the Rocks Cluster Distribution.

Included in this volume are chapters on Roll development, Kickstart XML,
Distribtions, and Monitoring APIs. We indend this book for the Rocks developer,
who is anyone who will add to the Rocks system. In each section of this
document, we strive to give the developer enough information to expand and
extend our structures.
