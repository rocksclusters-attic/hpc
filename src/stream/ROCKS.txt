This is the Rocks-compiled version of streams. 
Streams is from the University of Virginia. See Reference section below  

I. Running
$ /opt/stream/bin/stream

By default this will allocate a thread for each CPU (core it detects
in the system).  You can can adjust this for the C
version. It has been compiled with -fopenmp, to run explicitly four
threads 

$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
$ /opt/stream/bin/stream


II. Recompiling
The doc directory contains the files used to create streams and the specific
compiler parameters. Openmp threading is on  by default for the C version, 
off for the fortran version 

To recompile streams (Tested only on a Rocks Frontend) :
	1. edit <os>.mk  <os=linux,sunos) 
	   Changes compiler options. You can 
	   also change the size of the memory used by streams with MEMSIZE 
	   parameter. MEMSIZE only affects the C version.

	2. make clean; make build
           This creates the stream and stream_f binaries
