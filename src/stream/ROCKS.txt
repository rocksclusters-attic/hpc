This is the Rocks-compiled version of streams. 

The
doc directory contains the files used to create streams and the specific
compiler parameters. Openmp threading is on  by default for the C version, 
off for the fortran version 

To recompile streams (Tested only on a Rocks Frontend) :
	1. edit <os>.mk  <os=linux,sunos) 
	   Changes compiler options. You can 
	   also change the size of the memory used by streams with MEMSIZE 
	   parameter. MEMSIZE only affects the C version.

	2. make clean; make build
           This creates the stream and stream_f binaries

To adjust number of threads for C version compiled with -fopenmp eg(to set to four)

$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
$ /opt/stream/bin/stream
